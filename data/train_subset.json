        "Ice however, expands when it freezes. As the water molecules lose heat, they vibrate less, and are able to form geometric patterns that take up more space. Remember that Density = Mass/Volume. As the volume of ice increases, the density of ice decreases and the ice floats.Something that molecules in a solid are constantly doing? Molecules in a solid are constantly vibrating. Heating a solid increases the vibration of the molecules. Solids stay fixed because of the attraction between their molecule \u2026 s. This can be broken by increasing heat and therefore vibration to the point of inducing a phase change.",
        "Widespread and abundant taxa are included in this category, on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. A young / baby of a muskrat is called a 'kitten, nestling, pinkie or pup'. The females are called 'doe' and males 'buck'. A muskrat group is called a 'colony, horde, pack, plague or swarm'. An adult muskrat is just a little longer than the brown rat but it weighs four times the weight of brown rat. It has a medium or dark brown coat with small but thick hair and the color of its belly is lighter than the body. The two-layer fur protects it from cold water. Instead of hair, they have scales on their long tail which flattens vertically to help them in swimming. Muskrats spend a lot of time in waterAgain, unlike a rat, the muskrat makes its presence known. Like the beaver, it can den in a lodge in the middle or along the shore of ponds, shimmering in the damp. These lodges, also called push-ups or mounds, are not as grand as beaver lodges. The muskrat does not haul in logs and slap on mud."
